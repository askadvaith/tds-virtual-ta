The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request.

These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work.

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us.",

    "content": "The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\nIsolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\nReproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\nPortability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n• Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards.",
